# Markowski_CSCI2270_FinalProject

--Project	Summary--
Project extends upon assignment 8, graphs, by creating a visual representation of a graph.  Uses graphics libraries to create a window that will display vertex names connected by lines, edges between vertexes.  Options to add and delete a vertex will be available.  Distances between vertexes and search algorithms may be incorporated.  Controls for the various options will be controlled by buttons located on the window.
